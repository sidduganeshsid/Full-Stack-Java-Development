# Servlet
A servlet is a Java programming class that runs on a server and handles client requests, typically via HTTP. Servlets are used to create dynamic web content and can process and respond to requests from web clients. They operate within a servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat) that manages their lifecycle, including loading, initialization, and handling client requests and responses. Servlets can read data from client requests (e.g., form data), generate responses (e.g., HTML or JSON), and interact with databases and other resources. They are platform-independent, efficient, and part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) ecosystem.
