# JDBC
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API in Java that allows Java applications to interact with databases. It provides a standard interface for connecting to a wide variety of databases, executing SQL queries and updates, and retrieving results. JDBC supports basic SQL operations such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. It includes classes and methods for establishing connections, executing SQL statements, handling result sets, and managing transaction control. JDBC drivers, specific to each database, translate the API calls into database-specific operations, enabling seamless communication between Java applications and databases.
