# MySQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for managing and manipulating databases. Developed by Oracle Corporation, MySQL is known for its reliability, performance, and ease of use. It supports a wide range of platforms and provides robust data security features. MySQL is often used in web applications due to its scalability and compatibility with various programming languages, including PHP, Java, and Python. It supports transactions, indexing, and replication, making it suitable for both small-scale applications and large, complex systems.
